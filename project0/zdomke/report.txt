My tldmap compiles but does not run correctly.
I kept running into allocation issues and Seg Faults.
I decided I had put in enough time to consider turning it in.
For Project1 I will start it earlier as Prof. Sventek recommended.
I will practice with gdb and valgrind to figure out where my errors are coming from.
I will practice malloc() and free() throughout this course to make sure I have a very good understanding of them. 
Overall I feel that I really need to work on my programming practices and start earlier.
