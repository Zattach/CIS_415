I feel generally good about htis proect.
It was difficult to get my head wrapped around the concept for a long time.
I felt like I understood what was being asked of me once I sat down and stared at the project for a while.
I was unable to finish, but I made it as far as I could.
I feel like the work I turned in is on the right path to being correct.
My assignment follows the flow-chart I made pretty carefully and I think the flow-chart is accurate.
Initially I worked with a few other students to understand the project and the diagram.

We have all included this:
"I worked with the following students when designing the diagram,
note we did not share diagrams, but instead discussed the flow of the program,
and how each piece communicated with other pieces"

The students are Noah Palmer, Zach Bauer, Justin Robles, and I want to say the girls name was Anna.
