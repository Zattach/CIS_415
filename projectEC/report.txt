This is my extra credit project. In this project I was able to translate most of the

given python code into c. However, I did get stuck and I gave in. I can tell that my error 

comes up in my version of process where I determine if the current string has already been

printed. This results in a seg fault. After spending much time on this project, I decided

studying for the final might be more productive for me. Not to mention the other finals

and midterms I had going on at the time. I know that you said you will not grade anything

that won't run, but I feel like I should at least turn in what I have completed.
