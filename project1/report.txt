My uspsv1 compiles without any warnings and it does not fork bomb.
While my program looks like it should work, I am sure it runs incorrectly.
I did not work on uspsv2, uspsv3, or uspsv4.
I was unable to finish the first part so I could not move on to the last three.
I decided to focus on studying for the midterm the last week of the project.
On the next project and the extra credit I will start earlier.
Throughout this course I will need to start on my projects earlier.
I also need to get more practice with gdb and valgrind.
